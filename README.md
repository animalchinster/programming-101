## Outline

### What Is a Computer Program?

*Goal: to ensure that the students have a fundamental understanding of what a computer program is.*

1. Ask the students if they can explain what a computer program is.
2. Introduce the [Simple English Wikipedia definition of a computer program](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program).
3. Discuss how computer programming enables us to "tell" computers how to do things.

### Where Are Computer Programs Used?

*Goal: to show the students how diverse computer programs are.*

1. Ask the students if they can name some computer programs they use or know of.
2. Discuss and give examples of different types of computer programs.

* Application
    * Amazon
    * Google
    * Minecraft
    * Netflix
    * Youtube
* System
    * Operating
        * Windows
        * Mac
        * Linux
    * Embedded
        * Calculator
        * Elevator
        * Robot
        * Traffic light
        * TV remote

### Why Should We Learn to Write Computer Programs?

*Goal: to convince the students that computer programming is a highly useful skill.*

1. Ask the students to complete some tasks manually.
    1. Count the number of words in a paragraph.
    2. Sort a some playing cards.
    3. Calculate an average.
    4. Finding something book (to illustrate indexing).
2. Ask the students how they completed the tasks.
3. Demonstrate and discuss how computer programs can make these tasks easier and more efficient in the following respects:
    1. Speed
    2. Accuracy
    3. Repeatibility
    4. Automation

### How Do We Write Computer Programs?

#### Lab

1. Introduction - Hello World

    Have the students write a simple program that prints the sentence "Hello World!"

2. Variables - 

#### Hello Name

Have the students modify their Hello World program print their name instead of "World" by using a variable.

#### Hello User

Have the students modify their Hello Name program to accept user input for the name instead of hard-coding the value.

#### Final Project - Game

### Conclusion
